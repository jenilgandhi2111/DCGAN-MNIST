# DCGAN-MNIST
```The DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network)provided some random noise is used to generate new samples from a given data of some sample images , for this demonstration I have used MNIST data set for numbers```
``We could evidently see that how training for more epochs let's us improve more and more below are some sample images I generated from the Generator``
